            <p>When I'm not finding and fixing PHP bugs, designing new custom websites, or sipping on a bottomless cup of coffee, you might find me rock climbing, rolling around in a Brazilian jiu jitsu class, or traveling to my next international destination.</p>

            <h3>Get to know me!</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in the US, I started travelling the world as soon as I had enough money to buy my first plane ticket. Five years later, I landed in Bali, Indonesia, where I currently live to this day. Throughout my travels, I never stopped improving my IT skills.</p><br />
            <p>I started by designing websites on WordPress for small businesses. This included a hypnotherapy clinic in exchange for free hypnosis sessions, a farm community in exchange for room, board and some unforgettable experiences, and even a guesthouse owner in exchange for a bed to sleep at night. With every job, I got better and better until eventually, I expanded my skills to the point that it just made more sense to code my own websites from scratch.</p><br /> 
            <p>I spent my free time learning Javascript, PHP, frameworks, you name it, just on youtube and free/cheap learning websites that I found online. Eventually, I landed my first real gig coding the frontend (and some backend) for B2B web apps. Nowadays, I do frontend coding for a US-based tech company, but I still help business owners from around the world to create sleek, modern websites that they can proudly show to their clients.</p><br />
